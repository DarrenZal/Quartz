Decentralized Science (DeSci) seeks to address issues in traditional scientific practices around funding, publishing, and collaboration. Discourse graphs provide an elegant framework that can support the full spectrum of scientific work - from synthesizing existing research to mapping out and funding new frontiers.
## Why Do We Need New Tools?

The traditional scientific process faces several challenges:
* Research collaboration is disincentivized by the "first author claims all" paradigm
* High-quality experimental work often goes uncredited when it's "just" supporting other papers
* Traditional publication methods delay sharing valuable insights until a complete narrative is formed
* Research funding lacks efficient markets for impact and risk-taking
* Synthesis of scientific knowledge is rare, time-consuming, and arduous for individual researchers [Chan, 2021]
* Increasing specialization creates silos, making it difficult to interpret findings across domains
* Limited search capabilities hamper discovery across fields due to terminology differences

## Graph-Based Science: From Simple to Sophisticated

[Discourse graphs](https://ask.pubpub.org/about) provide an elegent framework for structuring and sharing scientific arguments:
- Questions that drive inquiry
- Claims that propose answers
- Evidence that supports claims
- Clear links between these elements
- Granular representation at the claim level while preserving crucial context
- Ability to decompose complex arguments while maintaining connections to supporting evidence [Chan, 2021]

This simple structure enables:
- Early sharing of progress
- Building upon others' work effectively
- Tracking contributions transparently
- Facilitating [decentralized coordination](https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-a-decentralized-discourse-graph/) and peer review
- Understanding and properly interpreting findings across different domains

### From Knowledge Synthesis to Full Research Lifecycle

Discourse graphs currently focus on two primary functions:
1. **Knowledge Synthesis and Sharing**
   - Structured representation of scientific claims and evidence
   - Facilitating literature review and gap analysis
   - Accelerating researcher onboarding through structured knowledge
   - Supporting cross-domain discovery and integration

2. **Open-source, Modular Research Communication**
   - Breaking research into discrete, reusable units (questions/claims/evidence)
   - Enabling collaborative, iterative research development
   - Supporting transparent attribution of contributions
   - Facilitating discovery of collaboration opportunities

The basic discourse graph framework can be extended to accommodate the entire scientific process, particularly through goal-oriented models like the Outcomes Graph. This extension adds several key capabilities:

1. **Goal-Oriented Structure**
   - Define clear goal states as positive statements of capability or achievement
   - Map pathways from current knowledge to desired outcomes
   - Identify and categorize constraints and potential solutions:
     - Constraints: Known impossible outcomes with complete understanding
     - Solutions: Known possible outcomes with high understanding
     - Hypothesized constraints: Potentially impossible outcomes with low understanding
     - Hypothesized solutions: Potentially possible outcomes with low understanding
   - Track both technical and commercial viability through evidenced discussions

2. **Strategic Elements**
   - Open problems blocking progress
   - Research directions and approaches
   - Market constraints and opportunities
   - Logical relationships (AND/OR) between outcomes that determine:
     - Necessity: How uniquely an outcome enables other outcomes
     - Sufficiency: The degree to which an outcome enables others by itself
   - Evidence tracking for all claims and relationships

3. **Applied Science Coordination**
   - Track market and scientific research findings
   - Enable cross-domain communication through structured knowledge representation
   - Support venture creation by identifying:
     - Areas of neglect (fewer existing companies)
     - Opportunities for combinatorial innovation
     - Critical pathways and bottlenecks
   - Map optimal paths to achieving high-impact ventures
   - Identify non-obvious intervention points through knowledge combination

This evolution enables discourse graphs to support:
- Research planning and coordination through structured outcome mapping
- Funding allocation and impact tracking based on necessity and sufficiency
- Collaborative research execution with clear attribution of contributions
- Knowledge synthesis and sharing across domains
- Research communication and discovery
- Rapid assembly of expertise for specific challenges
- Fair allocation of funding based on expertise and contribution profiles

By supporting the full research lifecycle in one integrated framework, discourse graphs help create a more efficient and collaborative scientific ecosystem that can effectively move the knowledge frontier forward through venture creation.
