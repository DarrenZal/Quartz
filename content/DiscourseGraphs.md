## Executive Summary

As we face increasingly complex global challenges, there's a growing need to transform our relationship with knowledge from passive consumption to active stewardship. Central to this transformation is the development of open protocols that can serve as composable building blocks for societal systems. Collective sensemaking emerges as a crucial capability, enabling communities to cultivate and propagate knowledge and wisdom effectively.

This proposal explores how <a href="https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-a-decentralized-discourse-graph/" target="_blank">**decentralized discourse graphs**</a> can be integrated into collective sensemaking protocols to enhance knowledge building, support the implementation of open protocols, and facilitate the evolutionary adaptation of our social systems. By emphasizing decentralization and democratization, we can ensure that knowledge networks become true commons—accessible to all and enriched by many.

## Introduction

In the face of an existential <a href="https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/" target="_blank">**metacrisis**</a>, humanity must reimagine itself as an intrinsic part of the living world, responsible for the vitality of our planet and communities. <a href="https://opencivics.co/" target="_blank">**OpenCivics**</a> proposes an approach where civic infrastructures localize and distribute resources and decision-making via open, participatory mechanisms. This necessitates the development of [open protocols](/OpenProtocols)—patterns of human coordination that function as civilizational services using a networked approach.

### The Value of Decentralized Discourse

To effectively develop and propagate open protocols, we require a decentralized, democratized method for mapping and [synthesizing](https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-synthesis/)  collective knowledge. <a href="https://scalingsynthesis.com/q-what-is-a-decentralized-discourse-graph/" target="_blank">**Decentralized discourse graphs**</a>
 offer a solution by enabling bottom-up knowledge creation across multiple domains.

## What Are Discourse Graphs?

[Discourse graphs](https://ask.pubpub.org/about) are data structures that represent knowledge as a network of interconnected nodes—such as questions, claims, evidence—and relationships like supports or opposes.

The concept of discourse graphs as a structured approach to organizing knowledge has evolved over time, with different variants emerging to suit various needs and contexts. The discourse graph model described above is based on conventions proposed by <a href="https://joelchan.me/" target="_blank">**Joel Chan**</a>. However, adaptations have developed in other academic fields, reflecting unique terminologies and practices.

For instance, biologist <a href="https://matsulab.com/" target="_blank">**Matt Akamatsu**</a>'s *Results Graph* modifies the discourse graph model to align with experimental science. In this model, experiments yield data that either supports or opposes specific conclusions and generates new hypotheses. This structure reflects the iterative nature of scientific inquiry, where hypotheses motivate further experimentation, and experimental conclusions contribute to our evolving scientific theories and models of the world.

In the Open Civics community, there is a unique opportunity to explore learning loops: how iterative experimentation, civic theory-building, and collaborative frameworks can be visually and structurally represented within discourse graphs to deepen our understanding of decentralized civilizational systems. Beyond conventional discourse and results graph ontologies, we might consider how implementations of protocols—each as an experiment in civic design—could generate evidence to support or refine civic hypotheses, thereby motivating further experimentation and adaptations across regions or contexts.

</details>

## Supporting Progressive Formalization

The process of <a href="https://scalingsynthesis.com/c-synthesis-tools-need-to-support-incremental-formalization/" target="_blank">**incremental formalization**</a> is crucial for protocol development, allowing communities to start with informal documentation and gradually add structure as patterns and needs emerge. This approach addresses the cognitive overhead and premature structuring challenges identified in knowledge management systems.


### Stage 1: Informal Exploration and Discovery
<details>
<summary>Lightweight Entry</summary><br/>
Begin with minimal structure to maximize exploration and reduce cognitive overhead.

- Allow free-form documentation of community practices
- Support varied media types and formats 
- Defer formal categorization until patterns emerge
</details>

<details>
<summary>Emergent Question Formation</summary><br/>
Building on The Society Library's methodology, discourse graphs can implement a "descriptive emergent structuring" approach where:

- Questions emerge organically from collected evidence and claims
- Multiple perspectives and approaches are documented informally
- Initial relationships form naturally through basic linking and tagging
- Pattern recognition algorithms suggest potential structural relationships
</details>

<details>
<summary>Community Documentation</summary><br/>
Enable natural documentation flows with minimal barriers to entry.

- Capture approaches and evidence in their natural form
- Use simple markup or tags for basic organization
- Allow multiple entry points based on user preference and context
</details>

### Stage 2: Incremental Formalization

<details>
<summary>Pattern Recognition</summary><br/><br/>
Identify and surface emerging patterns in community knowledge.

- Automated systems identify recurring patterns in informal documentation
- Community stewards suggest potential formal structures
- Users can accept, modify, or reject suggested formalizations
</details>

<details>
<summary>Collaborative Specification</summary><br/>
Convert emerging patterns into more formal protocol specifications.

- Convert successful patterns into protocol specifications
- Maintain flexibility to adapt specifications as needs evolve
- Support multiple levels of formality simultaneously
</details>

<details>
<summary>Relationship Development</summary><br/>
Allow relationships to formalize naturally as their value becomes apparent.

- Formalize relationships between nodes as their utility becomes clear
- Support both structured and unstructured connections
- Enable search-based relationship discovery
</details>

### Stage 3: Adaptation and Evolution

<details>
<summary>Local Customization</summary><br/>
Support contextual adaptation of formalized protocols.

- Communities adapt formal protocols to local contexts
- Document variations through playbooks
- Maintain links between formal and informal elements
</details>

<details>
<summary>Organic Growth</summary><br/>
Enable natural evolution of protocols through community practice.

- Protocols evolve through community usage patterns
- Support both structured evolution (forking/merging) and informal adaptation
- Enable cross-pollination of ideas across communities
</details>

### Implementation Support

<details>
<summary>Role Flexibility</summary><br/>
Support diverse community roles in the formalization process.

- Curators: Help identify emerging patterns
- Connectors: Surface potential relationships
- Formalizers: Assist in structuring mature content
- Mediators: Bridge between formal and informal approaches
</details>

<details>
<summary>Technical Features</summary><br/>
Provide tools that support incremental formalization.

For complete technical specifications and implementation details, see [[#Appendix A: Technical Specification]].


## Practical Applications

<a href="https://www.societylibrary.org/" target="_blank">**The Society Library**</a>'s success in mapping complex societal debates demonstrates the practical viability of structured knowledge representation for collective sensemaking. Their experience shows that careful attention to bias reduction, comprehensive media coverage, and emergent structure can help create truly representative knowledge commons. By incorporating these lessons into our discourse graphs approach, we can better ensure our knowledge networks serve as genuine tools for democratic deliberation and collective wisdom building.

### The Open Protocol Library as a Knowledge Commons

The concept of an open protocol library exemplifies how knowledge commons can be structured to support collaborative research and development. As illustrated in our flowcharts, scientific inquiry involves iterative cycles of synthesis and validation, where evidence informs claims and generates new questions. A protocol library serves as a vital infrastructure for this process.

Consider the case of quadratic funding in the Cascadia Bioregion (see [[#Appendix B: Case Studies]]). This example demonstrates how:
- Communities can adapt formal protocols to local contexts
- Evidence from implementations feeds back into protocol development
- Local variations contribute to the broader knowledge commons
- Query capabilities enable learning across implementations

- **Vocabulary Alignment:** Node types and relationships can be defined using standard RDF vocabularies or custom ontologies

Example of a Protocol node in JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://opencivics.org/ns/",
    "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@type": "Protocol",
  "@id": "protocol-qf",
  "dc:creator": "user111",
  "dc:contributor": ["user222"],
  "relationship": {
    "@type": "RelatedTo",
    "@id": "node-123"
  }
}
```
</details>
