title: A Proposed URI Scheme for Bioregions

In the face of ecological challenges, the concept of bioregions—areas defined by natural boundaries like watersheds—offers a powerful framework for fostering local stewardship and environmental regeneration. To collaborate effectively across diverse communities and organizations, we need a standard way to reference and share information about these regions. This is where a **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) comes in.

## What Is a URI, and Why Does It Matter?

A URI is a standardized way to name and identify things—like a webpage, a book, or in this case, a bioregion. Think of it as a unique digital label that allows anyone, anywhere, to reference the same entity without confusion. This shared identifier enables collaboration in systems like:

- **Open Linked Data**: Where URIs help connect and contextualize information across different platforms.
- **[Discourse Graphs](DiscourseGraphs.md)**: Tools that map and organize discussions and ideas to track collective understanding.
- **[Decentralized Science (DeSci)](GraphsForDeSci.md)**: A movement leveraging blockchain and open networks for transparent, reproducible science.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structured databases that connect entities (like bioregions) and their relationships.

A robust URI for bioregions ensures interoperability, making it easier for people and systems to share, query, and link information to support regenerative action.

## Proposed URI Scheme for Bioregions

### **Format**
```
bioregion:<name>:<lat>,<lon>[:optional-metadata]
```

- **`bioregion`**: A fixed prefix indicating the type of resource.
- **`<name>`**: The commonly recognized name of the bioregion (e.g., "Cascadia").
- **`<lat>,<lon>`**: The geospatial "pin" calculated as the centroid of the bioregion (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees).
- **`[:optional-metadata]`**: Additional qualifiers, such as `watershed` or `eco-region`.

### **Example**
- Cascadia Bioregion:  
  `bioregion:cascadia:45.512,-122.658`
- Amazon River Basin:  
  `bioregion:amazon-river-basin:-3.465,-62.215`

This scheme provides a clear and consistent way to reference bioregions while remaining human-readable and machine-actionable.

## Considerations for Smaller and Larger Regions

### **Smaller Regions (Sub-Bioregions)**

For regions smaller than bioregions, such as watersheds or ecological units within a bioregion, the URI could extend hierarchically to represent the subdivision:

**Format**:  
```
bioregion:<parent-name>:<lat>,<lon>:<sub-region-name>
```

- **Example**: Willamette Watershed within Cascadia:  
  `bioregion:cascadia:45.512,-122.658:willamette-watershed`

If no commonly accepted name exists, you could use a systematic or numeric identifier (e.g., Hydrologic Unit Codes for watersheds).

---

### **Larger Regions (Super-Bioregions)**

For larger regions, such as biogeographical realms or continents, a broader prefix helps distinguish their scope:

**Formats**:  
```
realm:<name>:<lat>,<lon>
continent:<name>:<lat>,<lon>
```

- **Example**: Neotropical Realm:  
  `realm:neotropical:-15.794,-47.882`
- **Example**: South America:  
  `continent:south-america:-14.235,-51.925`

This allows the scheme to scale, linking bioregions to their larger ecological or geopolitical context.

## How to Determine the Geospatial Pin

Since bioregions are defined by natural boundaries (not perfect geometric shapes), the geospatial pin is the **centroid**—the calculated "center" of the region. Here's how it's done:

1. **Gather Geospatial Data**: Use tools like GeoJSON, shapefiles, or other GIS data formats that represent the boundaries of the bioregion.  
2. **Calculate the Centroid**: Tools like Python’s `shapely` library or GIS platforms like QGIS can calculate the centroid of an irregular shape.
3. **Standardize Coordinates**: Use the WGS 84 format (latitude and longitude) to ensure global consistency.

This geospatial pin offers a consistent anchor point for identifying the bioregion.

## Existing Standards and Frameworks

Although no universal URI standard exists for bioregions, several frameworks provide valuable references:

- **One Earth Bioregions Framework**: Defines 185 bioregions using clear ecological and geographic rules, aligning with global standards.
- **WWF Ecoregions**: A widely recognized classification of ecological zones.
- **HydroSHEDS**: A global dataset for watersheds and hydrological units.
- **Geonames**: URIs for geographical locations, though less precise for ecological boundaries.
- **Wikidata**: Identifiers for some bioregions, though coverage is inconsistent.

Mapping your proposed scheme to these frameworks could enhance its adoption and interoperability.

## Why This Matters for Regenerative Efforts

URIs like the one proposed here enable decentralized and collaborative efforts to regenerate bioregions by:

1. **Linking Knowledge**: In knowledge graphs, the URI allows seamless linking of information about bioregions, such as ecological data, restoration projects, and governance models.
2. **Enabling Discourse**: Through discourse graphs, URIs anchor conversations, allowing contributors to map discussions back to specific bioregions.
3. **Driving Scientific Collaboration**: In decentralized science, URIs help researchers share datasets, methods, and findings about bioregions without ambiguity.

For example, a URI like `bioregion:cascadia:45.512,-122.658` could be referenced in:
- A **discourse graph** mapping ideas for sustainable water management.  
- A **knowledge graph** linking Cascadia’s flora, fauna, and eco-tourism potential.  
- A **scientific paper** proposing new conservation strategies for Cascadia.

## Next Steps

To make this vision a reality, the proposed URI scheme can be:
- **Adopted by organizations** creating open data repositories for bioregions.
- **Used in collaborative tools** like discourse graphs and decentralized platforms.  
- **Integrated into knowledge graphs** for ecological and bioregional data.

By accommodating regions smaller and larger than bioregions and aligning with existing frameworks, this URI scheme can provide a foundation for meaningful collaboration and regeneration.

Let’s build a future where collaboration thrives, and bioregions flourish. This URI scheme is one small step toward that vision—what do you think?
